* **Modular & Scalable**: Easily customizable components for log ingestion, parsing, analysis, and alerting.
* **Modern Detection Capabilities**: Support for rule-based and behavioral threat detection using community-driven threat intel.

### Core Stack (DRAFT)

* Data Ingestion: **Fluent Bit**, **Logstash**, or **Beats**
* Storage & Search: **OpenSearch** / **Elasticsearch**
* Visualization: **Kibana** / **OpenSearch Dashboards**
* Detection: **Sigma rules**, **Suricata**, **Falco**
* Normalization: Based on **OSCF schema mappings**

### Who It's For
